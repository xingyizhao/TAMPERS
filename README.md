This repository contains code and resources associated to the paper: 

Xingyi zhao, Lu Zhang, Depeng Xu and Shuhan Yuan. 2022. **Generating Textual Adversaries with Minimal Perturbation**. In findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2022.

## Usage
You can find the fine tuned model from [[textattack]](https://huggingface.co/textattack).

To craft adversarial examples based on TAMPERS, run(attack "textattack/bert-base-uncased-rotten-tomatoes" for example):

```
python tampers.py --data_path data/MR.csv --victim_model "textattack/bert-base-uncased-rotten-tomatoes" --num 1000 --output_dir attack_result/)
```
